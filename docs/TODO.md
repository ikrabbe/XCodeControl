# TODO Version=3

_If you work on objectives from the TODO list, you should refer to the Version and the list Number below._

1. Implement the simple _setGroup_, _setTarget_ and _targetSourceFile_ options.
2. Implement an input file parser. My basic idea for this is, to simply use the program options as the
language. You might extend this idea by special script keywords or json structure arguments,
or whatever you like of course.
