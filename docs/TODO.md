# TODO Version=1

_If you work on objectives from the TODO list, you should refer to the Version and the list Number below.

1. Automatically load the `project.pbxproj` file from a single `*.xcodeproj/` folder on demand. It is a fatal error
to have more than one `*.xcodeproj/` folder in the working directory, if you relay on autoload.

2. Implement tool and option help.
